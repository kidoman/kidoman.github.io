title: "Goodbye ThoughtWorks"
---

As some of you might already know, June 10th is going to be my last day at ThoughtWorks.

Before I go any further, I must say: My 2.5 years journey in TW was really awesome.

I joined ThoughtWorks back in Feb 2012 (after 5+ years in [CGI](www.cgi.com)) and most days have been more exciting than any. It was quite a exciting journey as well, because even thought I have toyed around with programming since about 2001, this was my first professional gig (if you don't count the last year at CGI doing .NET development) head first into application development.

Met a lot of interesting people, made a lot of life long friends, and worked on a lot of [cool]({{< relref "post/thebot.md" >}}) [things]({{< relref "post/embd.md" >}}). And now its time to move on.

ThoughtWorks really helped me see what I wanted to do with my life. I was really hooked on to writing software, more so after I discovered [Go]({{< relref "post/testing-the-waters-with-golang.md" >}}). But I really wanted to apply this ability to working on my own project. Where I could really [sweat the small stuff](https://inconshreveable.com/09-09-2014/sweat-the-small-stuff/) and I could work towards giving users the best experience possible. Unfortunately, these things are really not possible in a consulting firm (which ThoughtWorks, by and large, is).

Therefore, I must say the hard goodbye and look excitedly towards my next gig ([SoStronk]({{< relref "post/sostronk.md" >}})).

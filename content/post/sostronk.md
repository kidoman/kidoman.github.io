I could not have asked for a better opportunity.

After spending some time contemplating the next step in life (beyond ThoughtWorks i.e.) I landed on this gig. For a while I was ready to settle for another day job (went and interviewed with Flipkart, but said no to the offer). However, even the mere thought of passing on this felt like stupidity to me.

[**SoStronk**](https://www.sostronk.com/) requires me to take on the CTO role (as a Co-Founder) to help build the next generation eSports platform.

For people who have been living under the rock, eSports - which stands for Electronic Sports - is the next big thing in entertainment. It took a while to take off, but just recently, **400,000** people watched the EMS One Katowice 2014 Championship live on Twitch.tv. [The Compendium](http://www.dota2.com/international/compendium/) managed to rack up a cool **$10.9 million** as the prize pool for the Dota 2 International. Gamers are getting [athletes VISA](http://www.theverge.com/2013/8/11/4611180/league-legends-gamer-gets-visa-recognizing-him-as-pro-athlete) to the USA so that they can go compete in the events.

I started gaming back in 2004 (and the majority of the time has been spent playing Counter Strike.) How exactly could I say no to an opportunity which would allow me to lean back on all those years of gaming experience (and programming) to build the ultimate platform for gamers everywhere?

That's right. I couldn't say no. Here's to much hard work and (hopefully) some well deserved success.

**Update 1 (2015-03-30)**: We broke the magic [**1 million simultaneous viewers**](http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2015/03/11685/) on the recently (Mar 2015) concluded **ESL One Katowice 2015 Major**. Thats a massive growth.

My name is **Karan Misra**. I am currently busy developing a next gen eSports platform ([SoStronk](https://www.sostronk.com)) at Archetype (serving as the CTO and Co-Founder). My various interests include overclocking, biking, programming, gaming, etc.

My open source contributions can be found [here](https://github.com/kidoman). And I sometimes [tweet](https://twitter.com/kidoman_) as well.

A more detailed **resume** can be seen [here]({{< relref "about/resume/index.md" >}}).

I can be reached at [kidoman@gmail.com](mailto:kidoman@gmail.com).
